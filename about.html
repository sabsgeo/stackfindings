<p>
  I am a self-motivated, enthusiastic, hands-on person who likes to get the hands dirty, solving problems in fields of cloud infrastructure/computing, website development, mobile app development, and embedded system development. I have 8+ years of industrial experience, of which 6+ years I worked with startups in different fields, exploring my interests. People who worked with me recognize me on my problem solving skills, system design ability, speed, and flexibility to learn new things, my agility on black box debugging, and explaining technology to non-tecnical people in simple language. My hobbies are traveling, having a lot of coffee, doing electronic, electrical, and decor projects for my home.
